# TODO Management

There **MUST** be a top-level `TODO.md` that has the *current list of tasks* that we are working on. It is intended to be a checklist, and should have sections that correspond to plans in the `doc/plans` directory, `BUGFIX:` items that are quick bugs we have identified. It is not intended to be a long-lived document but rather one for guiding development sessions.
