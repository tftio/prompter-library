# Planning Documents

All planning documents *MUST* be in `docs/plans`; they **MUST** all have the following format:

1. An explanation section first;
2. a rationale section second;
3. a brief explanation;
4. and a TODO style list of tasks.

The intended audience for planning documents is a senior software engineer working with an LLM coding agent. All tasks must be as explicit as possible.
